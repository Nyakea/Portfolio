    <h3>About me</h3>
    <img src="/home/shalyn/Documents/my-portfolio/images/portfolio2.jpg" alt="My photo">
    <p>I completed my high school education from Moi Girls' High School, Nairobi. After this, I got an opportunity to intern at a bank for a year. Here, I acquired skiils such as effective communication, efficient customer service, cohesive teamwork, interpersonal skills, active listening and problem-solving. Some of my interests include sustainability (sustsinable utilization of resources) and environmental conservation. My current hobbies include cooking, reading, completing puzzles and filling sudokus.</p>
    <p>Upon completion of high school, I began the search of a career path that I would find engaging, challenging as well as fulfilling. A friend suggested Moringa School as a starting place. Upon further research on the institution, I decided to take a class in programming to find out if a career in software development would be a career of interest to me.</p>
