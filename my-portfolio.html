            <img src="/home/shalyn/Documents/my-portfolio/images/portfolio2.jpg" alt="My photo">
            <p>I completed my high school education from Moi Girls' High School, Nairobi. After this, I got an
                opportunity to intern at a bank for a year. Here, I acquired skills such as effective communication,
                efficient customer service, cohesive teamwork, interpersonal skills, active listening and
                problem-solving. Some of my interests include sustainability (sustsinable utilization of resources) and
                environmental conservation. My current hobbies include cooking, reading, completing puzzles and filling
                sudokus.</p>
            <p>Upon completion of high school, I began the search of a career path that I would find engaging,
                challenging as well as fulfilling. A friend suggested Moringa School as a starting place. Upon further
                research on the institution, I decided to take a class in programming to find out if a career in
                software development would be a career of interest to me.</p>
