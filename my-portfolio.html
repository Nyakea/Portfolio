        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <img src="/home/shalyn/Documents/my-portfolio/images/portfolio2.jpg" alt="My photo">
        <p>I completed my high school education from Moi Girls' High School, Nairobi. After this, I got an
            opportunity to intern at a bank for a year. Here, I acquired skills such as effective communication,
            efficient customer service, cohesive teamwork, interpersonal skills, active listening and
            problem-solving. Some of my interests include sustainability (sustsinable utilization of resources) and
            environmental conservation. My current hobbies include <strong>cooking, reading, completing puzzles</strong> and <strong>filling
                sudokus.</strong></p>
        <p>Upon completion of high school, I began the search of a career path that I would find <em>engaging,
            challenging</em>  as well as <em>fulfilling</em>. A friend suggested Moringa School as a starting place. Upon further
            research on the institution, I decided to take a class in programming to find out if a career in
            software development would be a career of interest to me.</p>
